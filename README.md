This project demonstrates a fully functioning eCommerce luxury and streetwear retailer website utilizing the *MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack*.

Front-end: ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Redux  
Back-end: NodeJS, ExpressJS  
Database: MongoDB  
Version Control: Git Bash  

## /frontend/src

**/screens:**  
The visual implementations of pages, such as the homepage, cart, login, profile, list of products, etc.

**/components:**  
Potentially reuseable parts of a screen, such as the header, and sort by category sidebar

**/constants:**  
The action keywords that indicate the state to update in their respective reducers provided in /reducers. ie: product delete request/success/fail

**/reducers:**  
The reducers that determine the changes to an application's state depending on the action keywords provided. ie: product delete request/success/fail -> update state of product

**/actions:**  
The actions that are called in the screen component, that describe the distinct operations requested by the different functionalities provided in the screen, and dispatch the appropriate state updates provided by /reducers. ie: save new product button clicked -> calls route in backend that completes this operation -> depending on request/success/fail, update the state of relevant elements

**App.js:**  
The main container component for all other components, such as screens

**store.js:**  
A state container holding the application's various states

**index.css:**  
The styling specifications of the application

## /backend

**/models:**  
The data model describing the shape and structure of saving documents, such as product/user information

**/routes:**  
The routes that dictate the operation associated with an HTTP verb, such as GET list of products, DELETE user, etc.

**server.js:**  
The configurations of the server utilized by the web application. ie: connections to routes, the database, etc. 

**config.js:**  
Contains commonly used variables in the backend parts of the web application (ie: Database URL in a dotenv file)

**util.js:**  
Contains utility functions, such as middlewares, admin verification, and tokenization functions

## Features

**Feature 1:**  
Add to cart functionality utilizing redux state management.  
Cart information is stored locally through js-cookie management, so users may navigate through different pages without losing their cart information.

**Feature 2:**  
Admin/User login controlled by JWT authentication.  
User information is tokenized and verified with the database to safely record, and match login information.  
Users may update their information through the profile page, and available functionalities differ depending on admin status (ie: manage products, users).  
Once logged in, user information is stored via cookie, with tokens that expire by the designated session timer. During this time, users may navigate through different pages and return, without having to re-login.

**Feature 3:**  
Users may sort the list of products by the categories offered on the left, and right components, by clothing type, brand, price, and arrival date.  
In case the user is on a different page, the user may use the hamburger on the top left, to instantly access the sort by category component.  

**Feature 4:**  
Admins may create products by filling the required information on the modal, which automatically updates the list of products on the main page.  
Images are encoded and stored automatically in the database, removing the need to store the images locally.  

**Feature 5:**  
Admins may also edit, and delete products.  
Similar to products, admins may create/read/edit/delete users and user information. However, admins may not create another admin account through the interface, which was intentionally disabled due to potential security concerns.  
No restarts or refreshes are needed to update rendering information. All changes to products and users are reflected instantaneously in display.
